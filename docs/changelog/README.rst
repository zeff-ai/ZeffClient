This is the "newsfragments" used by ``towncrier`` to create ``CHANGELOG``.
It contains small reStructuredText formatted text that will be used to
create the changelog.

The ``CHANGELOG`` will be read by users of ZeffClient, so the descriptions
should be aimed at them and not describing changes meant for developers of
ZeffClient.

News fragment filenames should use the format as described in
`towncier <https://github.com/hawkowl/towncrier#news-fragments>`_.
