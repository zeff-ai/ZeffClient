ZeffClient CSV Example
======================

This is an example of how to build records from a CSV file.

The ``properties.csv`` has a single entry with a primary key of 1395678
where all the other columns in the entry are key value pairs for building
structured data in the record. There is also an ``images_1395678`` directory
that has images that will be added as unstructured data to the record.

If a new entry is added to the ``properties.csv`` file then an images
directory with a matching id must be created as well. For example: add an
entry with id 1234567 and create a directory ``images_1234567``.
